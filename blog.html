                <p class="text-gray-600">
                    Bangladesh has been severely affected by recurring floods, displacing millions of people and damaging critical infrastructure. Your donations provide immediate relief to those affected by such disasters, offering emergency food, shelter, and medical supplies to flood-impacted communities. Our recent flood-relief efforts in Noakhali and Feni have made a significant impact, reaching more than 10,000 individuals who were stranded due to rising waters.

                <p class="text-gray-600">
                    In times of disaster, community resilience is critical to recovery. The people of Bangladesh have shown incredible strength and solidarity in the face of adversity. With the help of donors like you, communities are better equipped to withstand disasters and bounce back stronger. We partner with local organizations and volunteers to ensure that aid reaches those who need it most, while also empowering communities to rebuild and become more resilient to future crises.

                <p class="text-gray-600 mt-4">
                    Your donations go beyond immediate relief. They help build sustainable systems that ensure communities are prepared for the future. From setting up local emergency response teams to providing long-term rehabilitation, your support enables communities to stand strong in the face of challenges.

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Understanding the Document Object Model (DOM)</h2>
                <!-- Question 1 -->
                <details class="mb-4">
                    <summary class="font-semibold text-xl">1. What is the DOM?</summary>
                    <p class="mt-2 text-gray-600">
                        The DOM (Document Object Model) is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style, and content. The DOM represents the document as nodes and objects; that way, programming languages like JavaScript can interact with the page.
                    </p>
                </details>
    
                <!-- Question 2 -->
                <details class="mb-4">
                    <summary class="font-semibold text-xl">2. How can you manipulate the DOM using JavaScript?</summary>
                    <p class="mt-2 text-gray-600">
                        You can manipulate the DOM using JavaScript by selecting elements (via methods like `getElementById`, `querySelector`, etc.), changing their content (`innerHTML`, `textContent`), altering their styles (`style` property), or even adding and removing elements dynamically using `createElement` and `removeChild`.
                    </p>
                </details>
    
                <!-- Question 3 -->
                <details class="mb-4">
                    <summary class="font-semibold text-xl">3. What are DOM events?</summary>
                    <p class="mt-2 text-gray-600">
                        DOM events are actions that occur in the browser (such as a click, keypress, or page load). You can respond to these events by attaching event listeners to elements. For example, you can handle a button click using `addEventListener` to execute a function when the button is clicked.
                    </p>
                </details>
    
                <!-- Question 4 -->
                <details>
                    <summary class="font-semibold text-xl">4. What is event delegation in the DOM?</summary>
                    <p class="mt-2 text-gray-600">
                        Event delegation is a technique where you attach a single event listener to a parent element to manage events triggered by its child elements. Instead of adding multiple event listeners to individual child elements, event delegation allows you to handle events efficiently using event bubbling, where the event flows from the target element to the parent.
